== Outlook

With 1.4 Final released, planning for the 1.5 version (due by the end of March) is currently underway.
The link:/roadmap/[roadmap] is still being discussed, so be sure to let us know about your requirements and feature requests.
Some of the things we're considering for this next release are:

* Moving the MySQL connector to the CDC connector framework shared by most other Debezium connectors; this will drastically reduce maintenance burden of this connector in the future
* Exploring more powerful snapshotting options (e.g. for parallelization and re-doing snapshots of selected tables)
* Continued stability and improvements to the new LogMiner-based implementation for Oracle

Until then remain safe, it's onwards and upwards from here!
