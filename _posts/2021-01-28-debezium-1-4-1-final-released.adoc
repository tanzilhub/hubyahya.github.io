I'm pleased to announce the release of Debezium *1.4.1.Final*!

We highly recommend upgrading from 1.4.0.Final and earlier versions as this release includes bug fixes and enhancements to several Debezium connectors which includes some of the following:
+++<!-- more -->+++

* [MySQL] - Use collation to get charset when charset is not set (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2922[DBZ-2922])
* [MySQL] - Debezium Connectors are failing while reading binlog: Unknown event type 100 (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2499[DBZ-2499])
* [MySQL] - Some column default values are not extracted correctly while reading table structure (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2698[DBZ-2698])
* [MySQL] - Default database charset is not recorded (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2921[DBZ-2921])
* [MySQL] - Labeled create procedure's body is not parsed (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2972[DBZ-2972])
* [Oracle] - Supplemental logging is required for entire database rather than per monitored table (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2711[DBZ-2711])
* [Oracle] - Missing log file error when current SCN differs from snapshotted in Oracle connector and Logminer (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2855[DBZ-2855])

* [PostgreSQL] - Instable test: PostgresConnectorIT#testCustomSnapshotterSnapshotCompleteLifecycleHook() (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2938[DBZ-2938])
* [PostgreSQL] - Postgres connector config validation fails because current connector is occupying replication slot (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2952[DBZ-2952])
* [SQL Server] - Add support for binary.handling.mode to the SQL Server connector (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-2912[DBZ-2912])
